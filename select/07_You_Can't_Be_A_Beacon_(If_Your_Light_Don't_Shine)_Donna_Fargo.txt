You can't be a beacon if your light don't shine
You can't be a beacon if your light don't shine
There's a little light in all of us by God's design
But you can't be a beacon if your light don't shine

How can you ask for truth when you do not truthful live
How can you ask forgiveness when you don't forgive
I don't mean to bring you down or speak to you unkind
But you can't be a beacon if your light don't shine

You can't be a beacon if your light don't shine
You can't be a beacon if your light don't shine
There's a little light in all of us by God's design
But you can't be a beacon if your light don't shine

How can you ask a child to be honest and true
When he can only judge what's right by what he sees in you
How can you offer vision yet walk around blind
No, you can't see a beacon if it's light don't shine

You can't be a beacon if your light don't shine
You can't be a beacon if your light don't shine
There's a little light in all of us by God's design
But you can't be a beacon if your light don't shine

May God's love surround you may you find a brighter day
May He grant you the peace you seek in every way
God's light burns in each life, yours and mine
And you can be a beacon if you just let it shine

You can be a beacon if you let it shine
You can be a beacon if you let it shine
There's a little light in all of us by God's design
You can be a beacon if you let it shine

You can be a beacon if you let it shine
You can be a beacon if you let it shine
There's a little light in all of us by God's design
You can be a beacon if you let it shine

You can be a beacon if you let it shine
You can be a beacon if you let it shine
There's a little light in all of us by God's design
You can be a beacon if you let it shine

You can be a beacon if you let it shine
