Go ahead with what you're doing
You don't have to pay me any mind
Don't think I won't get to it
'Cause I got plans for her tonight

You can watch her dance forever
You won't hold her in your arms tonight
When it's all said and done
I will be the one to hold her tight

So let her shine, shine, shine
Step back and let that little girl shine, shine, shine
When the night is over she'll be mine, mine, mine
Step back and let that little girl shine

She's like a brand new penny
To a boy who's never had a dime
See her sparkle, see her glitter
No one holds a candle when she shines

She turns a mile a minute
See her twirl just like spinning top
But it's all said and done
I will be the one when the music stops

So let her shine, shine, shine
Step back and let that little girl shine, shine, shine
When the night is over she'll be mine, mine, mine
Step back and let that little girl shine

You can watch her dance forever
You won't hold her in your arms tonight
When it's all said and done
I will be the one to hold her tight

So let her shine, shine, shine
Step back and let that little girl shine, shine, shine
When the night is over she'll be mine, mine, mine
Step back and let that little girl shine

Yeah, let her shine
Step back and let that little girl shine, shine, shine
When the night is over she'll be mine, mine, mine
Step back and let that little girl shine

Yeah, shine, shine, shine
